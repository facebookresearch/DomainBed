# SAND-mask Repository

This repo is the code release for "[SAND-mask: An Enhanced Gradient Masking Strategy for the Discovery of Invariances in Domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02266)".

# Forked from DomainBed

This project is mainly developed on top of the DomainBed repository, which is a PyTorch suite containing benchmark datasets and algorithms for domain generalization, as introduced in [In Search of Lost Domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01434).

Send us a PR to add your dataset! Any custom image dataset with folder structure `dataset/domain/class/image.xyz` is readily usable. While we include some datasets from the [WILDS project](https://wilds.stanford.edu/), please use their [official code](https://github.com/p-lambda/wilds/) if you wish to participate in their leaderboard.

## Available model selection criteria

[Model selection criteria](domainbed/model_selection.py) differ in what data is used to choose the best hyper-parameters for a given model:

* `IIDAccuracySelectionMethod`: A random subset from the data of the training domains.
* `LeaveOneOutSelectionMethod`: A random subset from the data of a held-out (not training, not testing) domain.
* `OracleSelectionMethod`: A random subset from the data of the test domain.

## Quick start

Download the datasets:

```sh
python -m domainbed.scripts.download \
       --data_dir=/my/datasets/path
```

Train a model:

```sh
python -m domainbed.scripts.train\
       --algorithm SANDMask\
       --dataset Spirals\
       --test_env 0
```

Launch a sweep:

```sh
python -m domainbed.scripts.sweep launch\
       --data_dir=/my/datasets/path\
       --output_dir=/my/sweep/output/path\
       --command_launcher MyLauncher
```

Here, `MyLauncher` is your cluster's command launcher, as implemented in `command_launchers.py`. At the time of writing, the entire sweep trains tens of thousands of models (all algorithms x all datasets x 3 independent trials x 20 random hyper-parameter choices). You can pass arguments to make the sweep smaller:

```sh
python -m domainbed.scripts.sweep launch\
       --data_dir=/my/datasets/path\
       --output_dir=/my/sweep/output/path\
       --command_launcher MyLauncher\
       --algorithms SANDMask\
       --datasets Spirals\
       --n_hparams 20\
       --n_trials 3
```

After all jobs have either succeeded or failed, you can delete the data from failed jobs with ``python -m domainbed.scripts.sweep delete_incomplete`` and then re-launch them by running ``python -m domainbed.scripts.sweep launch`` again. Specify the same command-line arguments in all calls to `sweep` as you did the first time; this is how the sweep script knows which jobs were launched originally.

To view the results of your sweep:

````sh
python -m domainbed.scripts.collect_results\
       --input_dir=/my/sweep/output/path
````

## Running unit tests

DomainBed includes some unit tests and end-to-end tests. While not exhaustive, but they are a good sanity-check. To run the tests:

```sh
python -m unittest discover
```

By default, this only runs tests which don't depend on a dataset directory. To run those tests as well:

```sh
DATA_DIR=/my/datasets/path python -m unittest discover
```
